It includes 
-  puppi weight and NNVtx score in the PUPPI collection
-  NNVtx association ON for the charged tracks
-  PUPPI collection is the same as PF candidates (useful for PUPPI studies)
-  New ratios are saved in the ntuples

# MET computation

- The notebook `Reproduce_MET.ipynb` includes code to check that the MET and PUPPI computations on top of fastPUPPI ntuples is correct and it works.
- The notebook `MET_pipeline.ipynb` runs on fastPUPPI ntuples and computes the new PUPPi collection with new targets, compares it with the original PUPPI collection, and computes the MET for both.
